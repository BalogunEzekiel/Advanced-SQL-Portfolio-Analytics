# Advanced SQL Portfolio Analytics 🚀

Welcome to my Advanced SQL Portfolio, where I demonstrate my ability to manipulate, analyze and derive insights from real-world business data using advanced SQL techniques. This project features complex joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), indexing, grouping and performance tuning through EXPLAIN statements.

🔍 Objective:
To showcase my SQL expertise using real-world inspired queries that support data-driven business decisions — ideal for positions in data analysis, business intelligence and database management.

- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex logic
- CASE statements for customer segmentation
- Index creation and performance tuning
- `EXPLAIN` for SQL optimization
- Temporal queries (`YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, date ranges)
