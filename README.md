# üéØ Advanced SQL Portfolio Analytics üöÄ

Welcome to my Advanced SQL Portfolio, where I demonstrate my ability to manipulate, analyze and derive insights from real-world business data using advanced SQL techniques inspired by **Amazon's global operations**. This project features complex joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), indexing, grouping and performance tuning through EXPLAIN statements.

### üîç Objective:

To showcase my SQL expertise using real-world queries that support data-driven business decisions ‚Äî ideal for positions in data analysis, business intelligence and database management. It exhibits how SQL supports data-driven decisions at Amazon by enabling customer segmentation, operational efficiency, sales optimization and executive-level insights.

### üìä Use Case Overview

This project simulates the analytics operations of Amazon by managing customers data, transactions, orders and payments to uncover business insights, optimize decision-making and improve operational efficiency, by:

* Segment customers by behavior and location.

* Analyze revenue trends across products and regions.

* Optimize performance through indexing and query planning.

* Provide insights on sales, customer engagement, and revenue contributions.

### üè¢ Real-Life Company Application: Amazon
Amazon processes billions of customer and transaction records daily. The company leverages advanced SQL to:

üß† Segment customers by demographics, behavior and Prime membership

üåç Analyze multi-regional sales performance (e.g. U.S., UK, India)

‚öôÔ∏è Optimize delivery and warehouse operations

üìà Drive business intelligence for pricing, promotions and supply chain

## üîß SQL Operations Demonstrated

**Tables:**

* customer

* transaction

**1. üß© Complex Joins**

*-- Full Outer Join using UNION of LEFT and RIGHT Joins*

SELECT c.Customer_ID AS customer_id, c.Name AS customer_name, c.Province, c.Income, t.Transaction_ID AS transaction_id, t.Amount, t.Transaction_Type, t.Date

FROM customer c

LEFT JOIN transaction t ON c.Customer_ID = t.Customer_ID

UNION

SELECT c.Customer_ID AS customer_id, c.Name AS customer_name, c.Province, c.Income, t.Transaction_ID AS transaction_id, t.Amount, t.Transaction_Type, t.Date

FROM customer c

RIGHT JOIN transaction t ON c.Customer_ID = t.Customer_ID;

***Use Case: Retrieve a comprehensive view of all customers and transactions, including those with no matching records. Even if a customer hasn‚Äôt made a transaction, include them in CRM analysis‚Äîessential for onboarding campaigns.***

---

**2. üèÜ Top Customers by Spend**

*-- Subquery to find customer with max total transaction amount*

SELECT c.Customer_ID, c.Name, c.Province, c.Income, total_amount

FROM customer c

JOIN (SELECT Customer_ID, SUM(Amount) AS total_amount

FROM transaction

GROUP BY Customer_ID) t ON c.Customer_ID = t.Customer_ID

WHERE t.total_amount = (SELECT MAX(total_sum)

FROM (SELECT Customer_ID, SUM(Amount) AS total_sum

FROM transaction

GROUP BY Customer_ID) sub);

***Use Case: Identify your most valuable customer based on transaction volume. Identify Amazon Prime customers with high purchase volumes for early product testing or premium support.***

---

**3. üó∫Ô∏è Regional Customer Segmentation**

*-- Customers in Texas and Folida provinces*

SELECT Customer_ID, Name, Province, Income

FROM customer

WHERE Province = 'Texas'

UNION

SELECT Customer_ID, Name, Province, Income

FROM customer

WHERE Province = 'Florida';

***Use Case: Analyze customer distribution in key markets. Analyze demand concentration for province warehouse strategy.***

---

**Tables:**

* orders

* payments


**4. üì¶ Customer Spending Trends**

*-- CTE for total customer spend*

WITH customer_totals AS (SELECT CustomerName, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY CustomerName)
SELECT CustomerName, total_spent
FROM customer_totals
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

***Use Case: Rank customers based on order value. Build recommendation engines based on lifetime order value.***

---

**5. üí∞ Revenue by Product & Region**

*-- Grouped revenue with rollups*

SELECT Region, Product, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY Region, Product WITH ROLLUP;

***Use Case: Understand top-performing regions and products. Prioritize logistics to high-demand product-region combinations.***

---

**6. üóìÔ∏è Time Series Analysis**

*-- Extracting year and month for time-based trend analysis*

SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate, YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth, Product, Quantity, Price, Region
FROM orders;

***Use Case: Build monthly sales dashboards. Seasonal planning for major events like Black Friday or Prime Day.***

---

**7. üë• Age-Based Customer Segmentation**

*-- Grouping customers by age brackets*

SELECT CASE 
  WHEN c.age < 20 THEN 'Under 20'
  WHEN c.age BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN '20-29'
  ...
END AS age_group, SUM(t.amount_spent) ...
FROM customers c
JOIN transactions t ...
GROUP BY age_group;

***Use Case: Identify purchasing behavior by age group.***

---

**8. ‚ö° Indexing & Performance Optimization**

*-- Creating an index to speed up date-range queries*

CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_date ON transactions (transaction_date);

***Use Case: Optimize query performance for large datasets.***

---

**9. üîç Transaction Filtering**

*-- Filter transactions within a date range*

SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2023-05-13' AND '2023-05-31';

---

**10. üìà Customer Transaction Summary**

*-- Sales and transaction count per customer*

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(t.amount_spent), COUNT(t.transaction_id)
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN transactions t ...
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;

---

**11. üìä Execution Plan Analysis**

*-- Query plan insight using EXPLAIN*

EXPLAIN SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(t.amount_spent), ...
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN transactions t ...
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;

***Use Case: Improve query efficiency and detect bottlenecks.***
